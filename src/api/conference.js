        description: `This year’s theme is “Let’s Talk Peace!”. The Geneva Peace Talks 2014 will highlight how communication tools, techniques, and channels can contribute to resolving conflict. Speakers will reflect on how they have personally overcome the challenges of communication in their involvements in peacebuilding, communications, peace negotiations, as well as discussions with perpetrators of violence and underrepresented groups to build lasting peace.

Coming from violent and divided environments as well as backgrounds in science, art, business, and more, speakers will share their personal stories of peace and how communication has made a difference in their peacebuilding efforts.

The Geneva Peace Talks are a public event organized on the occasion of the International Day of Peace in a partnership between the United Nations Office at Geneva, Interpeace and the Geneva Peacebuilding Platform.`,

        description: `The relationship between law and religion is an actual and thorny problem, especially in the light of the development, in the Euro-Mediterranean area, of multiple ethical and religious feelings which have generated more and more complex and elaborate, as a result of the relevant migratory flows characterizing the present articulated relations. All this is the result of the relevant migrations which characterize the present situation.

The debate over the space to acknowledge juridical expectations deriving from the encounter/confrontation of different religions and cultures regards, among other issues, international, constitutional, regional and maritime laws.

Starting from theoretical, philosophical and legal considerations, this workshop aims at analyzing the links between the religious and juridical aspects of Mediterranean and European States.

The first session will examine the connection between religion and law in the light of the revolutions in North-African countries, with a special attention to gender and childhood rights.

The second session will be instead dedicated to the analysis of the concepts of pluralism and freedom of worship in the context of European public space, with a special attention to the experiences of several Euro-Mediterranean States, Italy among them.`,

Opposition groups held multiple meetings in Riyadh to decide who would attend the talks. And the international community repeatedly debated the fate of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, all in anticipation of negotiations that were scheduled to begin in January.

Those talks were delayed once but have now begun. But without main members of the opposition.
